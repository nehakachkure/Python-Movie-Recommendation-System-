# Python-Movie-Recommendation-System-

The Movie Recommendation System is a content-based filtering project that suggests similar movies based on their descriptions. It uses TF-IDF (Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency) and Cosine Similarity to measure how closely related the movies are in terms of their textual overviews.

This project demonstrates the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning concepts for recommendation tasks.
